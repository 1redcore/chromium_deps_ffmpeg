31_remove_attribute_deprecated.patch
  dalecurtis: Disables deprecated attribute for Chromium. Tracking bug here:
  http://crbug.com/112673

56_enable_checked_bitstream.patch
  dalecurtis: Removes "#define UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER 1" from all codecs
  defining it. In Chromium, all codecs should use the safe bitstream reader.

57_valgrind_asan_fixes.patch
  dalecurtis: Lots of fixes for crashes and memory leaks found during regression
  testing after roll to ea4037162fb0afa871e5312a7b23c828d2b85066.  See code
  review at https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/9373002/ for more details.

59_support_no_omit_frame_pointer_mac.patch
  dalecurtis: We need to compile with -fno-omit-frame-pointer on ia32 Mac for
  breakpad support.  See http://crbug.com/115170

  dalecurtis: Cherry-pick of fixes from libav for checked bitstream reader
  issues with seeking.

Patches still existing from the pre-GIT workflow:

to_upstream/
05_respect_flac_dirac_configure.patch
  rbultje: Nothing done yet. I'll try to get this upstream later, but it's
  no functional change so lower on my priority list.

11a_compile_with_disabled_features.patch
  Add CONFIG_* checks to make sure we don't use sipr/compression if
   enwantee(enwantedtche.g. webm doesn't support them).

11b_mkv_buffer_overflow.patch
  Remainder of the original patch.

12_ogg_seek_to_zero.patch
  rbultje: I've looked into this, but didn't get anywhere yet. I can
  reproduce the bug but the patch didn't really fix it. I'll try again.
  IHF: The remainder of 25_ogg_index.patch has been merged into this.

35_oggdec_duration.patch
  scherkus: Reverts FFmpeg commit 5901cd6236d97b34fe59a47ba0fd6da8f647d1f1
  which regressed duration calculation.
  dalecurtis: still broken after ffmpeg roll to
  ea4037162fb0afa871e5312a7b23c828d2b85066.

53_matroska_codec_config.patch
  cevans: avoid compiling in codec-specific code in Matroska if the codecs are
  not compiled in.

54_mov_stss.patch
  cevans: simple OOB read fix.

55_h264_nal.patch
  cevans: avoid OOB reads.
  dalecurtis: partially upstreamed already. updated patch file with non-upstream
  bits.

ugly/

41_matroska_cluster_incremental.patch
  Parse matroska clusters incrementally as opposed to all at once.
  Not for upstreamining as it needs work to handle SSA.
