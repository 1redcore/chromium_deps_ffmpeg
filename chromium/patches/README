  http://crbug.com/112673

56_enable_checked_bitstream.patch

  defining it. In Chromium, all codecs should use the safe bitstream reader.

57_valgrind_asan_fixes.patch

  testing after roll to ea4037162fb0afa871e5312a7b23c828d2b85066.  See code

Patches still existing from the pre-GIT workflow:

to_upstream/
05_respect_flac_dirac_configure.patch
  rbultje: Nothing done yet. I'll try to get this upstream later, but it's
  no functional change so lower on my priority list.

11a_compile_with_disabled_features.patch
  Add CONFIG_* checks to make sure we don't use sipr/compression if
   enwantee(enwantedtche.g. webm doesn't support them).

12_ogg_seek_to_zero.patch
  rbultje: I've looked into this, but didn't get anywhere yet. I can
  reproduce the bug but the patch didn't really fix it. I'll try again.
  IHF: The remainder of 25_ogg_index.patch has been merged into this.

35_oggdec_duration.patch
  scherkus: Reverts FFmpeg commit 5901cd6236d97b34fe59a47ba0fd6da8f647d1f1
  which regressed duration calculation.
  dalecurtis: still broken after ffmpeg roll to
  ea4037162fb0afa871e5312a7b23c828d2b85066.

53_matroska_codec_config.patch
  cevans: avoid compiling in codec-specific code in Matroska if the codecs are
  not compiled in.

54_mov_stss.patch
  cevans: simple OOB read fix.

55_h264_nal.patch
  cevans: avoid OOB reads.
  dalecurtis: partially upstreamed already. updated patch file with non-upstream
  bits.

ugly/

41_matroska_cluster_incremental.patch
  Parse matroska clusters incrementally as opposed to all at once.
  Not for upstreamining as it needs work to handle SSA.
