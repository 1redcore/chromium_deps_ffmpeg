Current Status as of November 28, 2011

from_upstream/
36_theora_flush.patch
  should permit threading of theora

38_webm_cues_before_first_cluster.patch
  acolwell: Fixes seeking for WebM files that have the CUES element before
  the first CLUSTER instead of at the end of the file.

51_vp3_coefficient_overflow.patch
  scherkus: Check coefficient index in vp3_dequant()


to_upstream/
01_static_pthread_O2.patch
  rbultje: Nothing done yet. I doubt this will go in upstream.
  IHF: move to ugly?

05_respect_flac_dirac_configure.patch
  rbultje: Nothing done yet. I'll try to get this upstream later, but it's 
  no functional change so lower on my priority list.

11a_compile_with_disabled_features.patch  
  Add CONFIG_* checks to make sure we don't use sipr/compression if 
  unwanted (e.g. webm doesn't support them). 

11b_mkv_buffer_overflow.patch
  Remainder of the original patch.

12_ogg_seek_to_zero.patch
  rbultje: I've looked into this, but didn't get anywhere yet. I can 
  reproduce the bug but the patch didn't really fix it. I'll try again.
  IHF: The remainder of 25_ogg_index.patch has been merged into this.

14_vp8_encode_options.patch
  Nothing yet.

15_webp_ffmpeg.patch
  Nothing yet.

34_ogg_memcpy.patch 
  cevans: Fixes a buffer overrun. The sequence is: 
  - ogg_save (2 streams)
  - ogg_read (clears all streams and restarts -> 1 stream)
  - ogg_restore (tries to copy 2 stream pointers into space for one)

35_oggdec_duration.patch
  scherkus: Reverts FFmpeg commit 5901cd6236d97b34fe59a47ba0fd6da8f647d1f1
  which regressed duration calculation.

37_VP8_armv6_optimizations.patch
  ports arm vp8 assembly from libvpx to support tegra2 decoding

39_VP8_fix_oob_read_writes.patch
  Fixes a bunch of overreads and overwrites.

40_MKV_fix_oob_write.patch
  Fixes an out-of-bounds write if laces==1 in MKV demuxer.

42_vp8_fix_segmentation_maps.patch
  rbultje: Associate segmentation_map[] with reference frame rather than
  decoding instance.

43_mkv_seekahead_revalidate.patch
  cevans: avoid caching a pointer that might move due to a realloc()

44_vorbis_oob_read.patch
  cevans: avoid the possibility of reading outside a static array of values

45_mkv_fix_segmap_cache_overflow.patch
  rbultje: fix overflow in segmentation map caching

46_vp3_fix_double_free_invalid_read.patch
  rbultje: fix corruption with corrupt input.

47_vp3_fix_infloop_and_memleak.patch
  rbultje: fix memleaks and a potential infinite loop after 46.

48_vorbis_residue_buffer.patch
  cevans: manage the writing to the residue buffer a little more tightly

49_vorbis_buffer_defense.patch
  cevans: a defensive patch; the Vorbis codec is always going off the end of
  its output buffer. Now, this should never happen again.

50_vp8_fix_frame_size_changes.patch
  acolwell: fixes invalid reads on the segment maps when the frame dimensions 
  change.

52_vorbis_fix_floor1_vector_int_overflow.patch
  rbultje: fix integer overflows in floor1[] vector and subsequent stack
  overflows in inverse db table.

ugly/
07_get_bits_overrun.patch
  Might get upstreamed as a compile-time macro (i.e., CHECK_FOR_OVERRUNS) but
  will likely need to be rewritten.

08_enforce_theora_oob.patch
  Needs investigating.

09_enforce_vorbis_oob_divzero.patch
  Needs investigating.

10_aac_oob_read.patch
  Needs investigating.

30_enforce_mp3_oob.patch
  Needs investigating.

31_remove_attribute_deprecated.patch
  CrOS still complains about deprecated attributes. Should be resolved by 
  changing Chromium code.
  Rejected upstream.

41_matroska_cluster_incremental.patch
  Parse matroska clusters incrementally as opposed to all at once.
  Not for upstreamining as it needs work to handle SSA.
