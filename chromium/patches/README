Current patches:

ugly/
01_enable_checked_bitstream.patch
  dalecurtis: Removes "#define UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER 1" from all codecs
  defining it. In Chromium, all codecs should use the safe bitstream reader.

06_enable_register_protocol.patch
  dalecurtis: FFmpeg/LibAV have deprecated support for external clients which
  want to register protocols.  Chrome requires this to work.  See patch for
  more details.

02_compile_with_disabled_features.patch
  dalecurtis: Add CONFIG_* checks to compile out code which we don't use which
  might be a security risk.  Discuss with cevans before removing.  Upstream does
  not want this patch.
