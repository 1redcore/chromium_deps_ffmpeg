  defining it. In Chromium, all codecs should use the safe bitstream reader.

  http://crbug.com/112673

06_enable_register_protocol.patch

  want to register protocols.  Chrome requires this to work.  See patch for
  more details.

to_upstream/
02_compile_with_disabled_features.patch
  dalecurtis: Add CONFIG_* checks to compile out code which we don't use which
  might be a security risk.  Discuss with cevans before removing.

03_ogg_seek_to_zero.patch
  dalecurtis: Seeking to zero works now, but frame timestamps don't line up.  A
  reproducible test case has been sent upstream.  Hopefully remove with M21.

04_oggdec_duration.patch
  dalecurtis: Upstream tracking bug: https://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/ticket/1186
