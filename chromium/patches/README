Current Status as of Dec 3, 2012


Upstream cherry-picks:
<upstream in progress> - aligned stack fixes for MSVC++.
<upstream in progress> - vp3 double-free fixes.


Current patches:

ugly/
01_enable_checked_bitstream.patch
  dalecurtis: Removes "#define UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER 1" from all codecs
  defining it. In Chromium, all codecs should use the safe bitstream reader.

02_compile_with_disabled_features.patch
  dalecurtis: Add CONFIG_* checks to compile out code which we don't use which
  might be a security risk.  Discuss with cevans before removing.  Upstream does
  not want this patch.

07_remove_av_gettime_symlink.patch
  dalecurtis: In order to preserve ABI compatibility after av_gettime() was
  moved inside the FFmpeg code base, they added a "symbolic link" version which
  our build chain doesn't like.  Remove it until the next major version bump.
